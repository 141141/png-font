## which font is this?

The image font used here is the **GNU Unifont**!

You can read more about in the website, which is mantained
by the awesome Paul Hardy: http://unifoundry.com/unifont.html .

## unifont AUTHORS

Roman Czyborra created the original GNU Unifont, including the
.hex format.  For greater detail, see the HISTORY in the GNU
Unifont README.

David Starner aggregated many glyphs contributed by others and
incorporated these into pre-2004 Unifont releases.

Qianqian Fang began his Wen Quan Yi font in 2004, by which
time work on Unifont had stopped.  Most of the almost 30,000
CJK ideographs in Unifont versions 5.1 and later were taken
from Wen Quan Yi with permission of Qianqian Fang.  The glyphs
in "./font/plane00/wqy-cjk.hex" are for the most part Qianqian
Fang's Unibit and Wen Quan Yi glyphs.

Paul Hardy drew most of the newly-drawn glyphs added to the BMP
from the Unifont 5.1 release to the present release.  This includes
the 11,172 glyphs in the Hangul Syllables block, plus approximately
10,000 additional glyphs scattered throughout the BMP.

Andrew Miller drew the glyphs added to Unicode 6.3.0.

For higher planes and the Private Use Area glyphs, see the
unifont ChangeLog file.
